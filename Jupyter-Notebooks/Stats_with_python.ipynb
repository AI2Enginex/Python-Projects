The standard deviation indicates a “typical” deviation from the mean. It is a popular measure of variability because it returns to the original units of measure of the data set.  Like the variance, if the data points are close to the mean, there is a small variation whereas the data points are highly spread out from the mean, then it has a high variance. Standard deviation calculates the extent to which the values differ from the average. Standard Deviation, the most widely used measure of dispersion, is based on all values. Therefore a change in even one value affects the value of standard deviation. It is independent of origin but not of scale. It is also useful in certain advanced statistical problems."
